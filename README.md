# From Data to Decisions

This repository explores how data is translated into insights that
support real-world business and technology decisions.

The focus here is not on complex algorithms, but on:
- Understanding the problem
- Working with imperfect data
- Choosing appropriate tools
- Communicating results clearly

## What You'll Find Here (Over Time)
- Small Python notebooks for data exploration
- SQL examples focused on business questions
- Notes on analytics workflows
- Lightweight documentation explaining decisions and trade-offs

## Why This Exists
Data only becomes valuable when it informs action.
This repository reflects a systems-oriented approach to analytics,
documentation, and decision-making.

## Status
This is an active learning repository. Content will evolve over time.
